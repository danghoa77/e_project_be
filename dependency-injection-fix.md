The `user-service` was failing with an `UnknownDependenciesException`, which indicated that the `Logger` was not properly injected into the `AuthController`. This was because the `Logger` was not included in the `providers` array of the `AuthModule`.

To fix this, I performed the following steps:

1.  **Imported `Logger`**: I added `Logger` to the import statement in `auth.module.ts`.
2.  **Added to `providers`**: I included `Logger` in the `providers` array of the `AuthModule`.

These changes ensure that the `Logger` is correctly provided to the `AuthController`, resolving the dependency injection error.
